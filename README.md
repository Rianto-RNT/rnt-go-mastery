## Deployed Version

Live demo (Feel free to visit) üëâ :

- [rnt-example-point](https://github.com)

## API Usage

Check:

[rnt-example-point](https://github.com)

for more info.

## Deployment

The website is deployed with build into Heroku. Below are the steps taken:

1. rnt-example-point

## Installation

You can fork the app or you can git-clone the app into your local machine. Once done that, please install all the dependencies by running

```sh
$ rnt-example-command
```

## Run App in Development

```sh
$ rnt-example-command
```

## Build With

- [Go](https://go.dev/) - Go is an open source programming language supported by Google

## Packages

- [rnt-example-point](https://github.com/)

## Development Process

### 1) Getting Started with Go

- GOPATH and Code Organization

  - Go requires you to organize your code in a speciÔ¨Åc way.
  - Go programmers typically keep all their Go code in a single workspace.
  - A workspace is nothing more than a directory in your Ô¨Åle system whose path is stored in
    the environment variable called GOPATH.
  - On Windows , it's in %USERPROFILE%\go (For Example: c:\Users\rianto\go)
  - On Mac & Linux, it's in: ~/go (For Example: /home/rianto/go)
  - You can print out the values of the environment variables by running the go env command.

- Go Application Structure

```sh
$ go run main.go
```

```sh
/////////////////////////////////
// The Typical Structure of a Go Application
// Go Playground: https://play.golang.org/p/vY_IeYBb1GN
/////////////////////////////////

// a package clause starts every source file
// main is a special name declaring an executable rather than a library (package)
package main

// import declaration declares packages used in this file
import "fmt"

// package scoped variables and constants
var x int = 100

const y = 0

// a function declaration. main is a special function name
// it is the entry point for the executable program
// Go uses brace brackets to delimit code blocks
func main() {

    // Local Scoped Variables and Constants Declarations, calling functions etc
    var a int = 7
    var b float64 = 3.5
    const c int = 10

    // Println() function prints out a line to stdout
    // It belongs to package fmt
    fmt.Println("Hello Go world!") // => Hello Go world!
    fmt.Println(a, b, c)           // => 7 3.5 10

}
```

- Compiling (go build) and Running Go application (go run)

  go is a tool for managing Go source code.

  I. go run: it compiles and runs the application. It doesn‚Äôt produce an executable

  - go run Ô¨Åle.go compiles and immediately runs Go programs.

  II. go build: it just compiles the application. It produces an executable

  - go build Ô¨Åle.go compiles a bunch of Go source Ô¨Åles. It compiles packages and dependencies.
  - If you run go build it will compile the Ô¨Åles in the current directory and will produce an executable Ô¨Åle with the name of the current working directory.

  - go build -o app will produce an executable Ô¨Åle called app

```sh
$ go run  main.go

or

$ go run -x main.go
```

```sh
// build

$ go build

or

$ go build -o <application-name.exe>
```

```sh
// on windows OS

$ GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 go build -o winapp.exe
```

```sh
// install

$ go install

or

$ go install <rnt-path-directory-application>
```

- Formating Go Source Code (gofmt)

  Go strongly suggests certain styles.

  - gofmt which comes from golang formatter will format a program's source code in an idiomatic way that is easy to read and understand.
  - This tool, gofmt, is built into the language runtime, and it formats Go code according to a set of stable, well-understood language rules.
  - We can run it manually at the command line or we can conÔ¨Ågure our IDE, for example VSCode, to run gofmt each time a Ô¨Åle is saved.
    Example: gofmt -l -w main.go

```sh
$ gofmt -w <rnt-file-name>

// or

$ gofmt -w -l <rnt-directory-name>
```

### 2) Go Basic

- Variables in Go
- Multiple Declarations
- Types and zero values
- Comments
- Naming convensions

  - By convention, packages are given lower case, single-word names;
  - Go doesn't provide automatic support for getters and setters. If you have a Ô¨Åeld in a struct called owner, the getter method should be called Owner (upper case, exported), not GetOwner.

  A setter function, if needed, will likely be called SetOwner.

```sh
owner := obj.Owner()

if owner != user {
obj.SetOwner(user)
}
```

- By convention, one-method interfaces are named by the method name plus an -er suÔ¨Éx: Reader, Writer, Formatter, etc.
