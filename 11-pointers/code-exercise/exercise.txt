How to solve these coding exercises:

Write your solution in Go Playground (https://play.golang.org) and then click on the Run button.

If your solution is not correct, then try to understand the error messages, rewrite the solution and press the Run button again. Repeat this step until you get the correct solution.

Each exercise should be solved in Go Playground in its own file. Save the URL of each file for future reference or recap.

Alternatively, you can write the solution in VSCode and run the program in terminal using: go run main.go



Coding Exercise #1

Consider the following variable declaration x := 10.10

1. Print out the address of x

2. Declare a pointer called ptr that stores the address of x.

3. Print out the type and the value of ptr.

4. Print the address of the pointer and the value of x though the pointer (use the dereferencing operator).

Coding Exercise #2

Consider the following variable declarations: 

x, y := 10, 2
ptrx, ptry := &x, &y
Declare a new variable called z and initialize the variable by dividing x by y through the pointers.

Coding Exercise #3

Consider the following variable declaration:x, y := 5.5, 8.8

Write a function that swaps the values of x and y. After calling the function x will be 8.8 and y will 5.5
