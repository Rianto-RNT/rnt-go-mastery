How to solve these coding exercises:

Write your solution in Go Playground (https://play.golang.org) and then click on the Run button.

If your solution is not correct, then try to understand the error messages, rewrite the solution and press the Run button again. Repeat this step until you get the correct solution.

Each exercise should be solved in Go Playground in its own file. Save the URL of each file for future reference or recap.

Alternatively, you can write the solution in VSCode and run the program in terminal using: go run main.go

Coding Exercise #6

Consider the following Go program: https://play.golang.org/p/r0xuO0bYkuY

package main
import "fmt"

func main() {
	age := -9
	if age < 0 || age > 100 {
		fmt.Println("Invalid Age")
	} else if age <= 18 {
		fmt.Println("You are minor!")
	} else if age == 18 {
		fmt.Println("Congratulations! You've just become major!")
	} else {
		fmt.Println("You are major!")
	}
}
Change the code and use a switch statement instead of if statement.
